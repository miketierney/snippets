## Snippets ##

This repo is just a collection of snippets that I've wanted to hang on to.  Not unlike gists, but more for my own not-keeping purposes.  Hopefully someone else will find these as useful as I do.  If you have any questions, you can email me at [panpainter@gmail.com](mailto:panpainter@gmail.com).  Thanks!

## WARNING ##
As these are nothing more than snippets, I really make no promise of extensive documentation.  Where I can, I'll make notes, but I can't promise that they'll mean much to anyone other than me.  You're more than welcome to ask me to clarify, but please keep in mind that initial caveat.
